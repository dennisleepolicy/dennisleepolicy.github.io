I am a research data analyst at the department of Health Policy and Management at Harvard University. I am interested in the use of rigorous research to shed light on healthcare systems and policy on vulnerable populations. 

I currently work with Professors Benjamin Sommers and Michael Barnett. With Professor Sommers, I have worked primarily on comparing costs, outcomes and quality for Medicaid and heavily-subsidized Marketplace health insurance for low-income individuals. With Professor Barnett, I have worked primarily on papers on buprenorphine policy to tackle the opioid crisis. 

Previously, I had also worked with Professor Margaret Kruk at the HQSS Commission on health care quality in low- and middle-income countries, culminating in a comprehensive report on 134 countries. I am a huge fan of interesting visualizations and have created an interactive database that showcases the datasets used in the Commission Report: http://hqssqualitydata.org/. 

I graduated with a degree in Economics and Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2016 and have since conducted analyses using methods found in epidemiology, biostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning. I have also published in journals such as The Lancet Global Health, Health Affairs, BMJ Open and Health Services Research.
