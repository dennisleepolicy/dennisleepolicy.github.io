**Abstract:** Few patients with opioid use disorder receive medication for addiction treatment. In 2017 the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act enabled nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) to obtain federal waivers allowing them to prescribe buprenorphine, a key medication for opioid use disorder. The waiver expansion was intended to increase patients’ access to opioid use treatment, which was particularly important for rural areas with few physicians. However, little is known about the adoption of these waivers by NPs or PAs in rural areas. Using federal data, we examined waiver adoption in rural areas and its association with scope-of-practice regulations, which set the extent to which NPs or PAs can prescribe medication. From 2016 to 2019 the number of waivered clinicians per 100,000 population in rural areas increased by 111 percent. NPs and PAs accounted for more than half of this increase and were the first waivered clinicians in 285 rural counties with 5.7 million residents. In rural areas, broad scope-of-practice regulations were associated with twice as many waivered NPs per 100,000 population as restricted scopes of practice were. The rapid growth in the numbers of NPs and PAs with buprenorphine waivers is a promising development in improving access to addiction treatment in rural areas.

 - *Methods:* Regression Discontinuity

**Objective:** To test whether a change from a telephone to mail and internet survey in January 2018 affected the sample composition and uninsured estimates in the Gallup-Sharecare WellBeing Index.
**Study design:** Regression discontinuity analysis identified changes after the survey redesign in the estimated U.S. uninsured rate (adults 18-64) and in the sample’s demographic composition.
**Principal findings:** After the survey redesign, the estimated uninsured rate fell 5.3 percentage points (p<0.001), and respondents were older, disproportionately white, college graduates, and higher-income. These changes were modestly reduced by survey weights.
**Conclusions:** The shift to a mail survey (with a web option) led to an older, more educated sample with fewer minorities, and a significant break-in-trend in the estimated uninsured rate.

[**Factors associated with positive user experience with primary healthcare providers in Mexico: a multilevel modelling approach using national cross-sectional data**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941761)

**OBJECTIVE:**
This study aimed to investigate factors associated with patient experience with primary care in a large public health system in Mexico and determine the amount of variability in experience attributable to facility-level and state-level factors.

**METHODS:**
We analysed cross-sectional 2016 national satisfaction survey data from the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). Patient-level data were merged with facility-level data and information on poverty by state. We assessed general contextual effects and examined the relationship of patient, facility and state factors with four patient experience measures using random effects logistic regression.

**RESULTS:**
25 745 patients' responses from 319 facilities were analysed. The majority experienced good communication (78%), the opportunity to share health concerns (91%) and resolution of doubts (85%). 29% of visits were rated as excellent. Differences between facilities and states accounted for up to 12% and 6% of the variation in patient experience, respectively. Inclusion of facility-level contextual effects improved model predictions by 8%-12%; models with facility random effects and individual covariates correctly predicted 64%-71% of individual outcomes. In adjusted models, larger patient population was correlated with worse reported communication, less opportunity to share concerns and less resolution of doubts. Men reported more positive communication; older individuals reported more positive communication and experiences overall, but less opportunity to share concerns; and more educated individuals were less likely to report positive communication but more likely to report resolution of doubts and overall positive experiences. Preventive care visits were rated higher than curative visits for resolution of doubts, but lower for opportunity to share concerns, and specific conditions were associated with better or worse reported experiences in some cases.

**CONCLUSION:**
Quality improvement efforts at IMSS facilities might bolster individual experiences with primary care, given that up to 12% of the variation in experience was attributable to facility-level differences. The relationship between individual characteristics and experience ratings reinforces the importance of patients' expectations of care and the potential for differential treatment by providers to impact experience.

[**Examining coverage, content and impact of maternal nutrition interventions: the case for quality-adjusted coverage measurement**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32082545)

**Introduction.** Reductions in neonatal mortality remain stagnant, despite gains in healthcare access and utilization. Adjusting coverage estimates for the quality of care provided yields greater insight into health system performance and potential population health benefits of accessing care. Nutrition interventions during antenatal care (ANC) are associated with reduced neonatal mortality. We adjust maternity care coverage measures for quality of nutrition interventions to determine the impact on infant birth weight and breastfeeding, two significant determinants of neonatal mortality.  
**Methods.** We used household data from the Malawi 2013-2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to assess use of maternal health services and direct observations of antenatal and delivery care from the 2013 Service Provision Assessment to measure the quality of nutrition interventions provided. Nutrition quality-adjusted metrics were developed for ANC and post-delivery care by combining self-reported utilization of care with the likelihood of receipt of nutrition interventions per encounter. We adjusted coverage measures for nutrition intervention content and quality and estimated their associations with infant birthweight and immediate breastfeeding.
**Results.** Health facility and household data provided over 2,500 directly observed clinical encounters and 7,385 individual reports of healthcare utilization and outcomes. ANC utilization and delivery in a health facility were high, with 98% of women attending any ANC and 90.7% of children delivered in a health facility. Women received nutrition-related interventions considerably less often than they sought care: over the course of ANC women received a median of 1.6 interventions on iron, 1 instance of nutrition counseling, and 0.06 instances of breastfeeding counseling. Nutrition quality-adjusted ANC coverage was associated with a reduced risk of low birth weight (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.79, 0.96) and increased likelihood of immediate breastfeeding (ARR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07); nutrition quality-adjusted post-delivery care was also associated with greater uptake of immediate breastfeeding (ARR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02, 1.14). Similar, but weaker, associations were found for crude coverage measures. If nutrition interventions were delivered consistently at the existing level of ANC coverage, our findings suggest that population prevalence of low birthweight would decrease from 13.7% to 10.8% and that population prevalence of immediate breastfeeding would increase from 75.9% to 86.0%.
**Conclusion.** Data on the content of care from health service provision assessments can be used to adjust reported crude coverage measures derived from household surveys. Despite high utilization of maternal health services in Malawi, the provision of nutrition interventions is low. Nutrition quality-adjusted coverage measures are associated with decreased low birthweight and increased immediate breastfeeding. Substantial gains in newborn health are possible in Malawi if quality of existing services is strengthened. 


[**Equity in antenatal care quality: an analysis of 91 national household surveys**](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30389-9/fulltext)

- *Methods:* random-effects meta-analyses, slope index of inequality and relative index of inequality 

**Background**
Emerging data show that many low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) health systems struggle to consistently provide good-quality care. Although monitoring of inequalities in access to health services has been the focus of major international efforts, inequalities in health-care quality have not been systematically examined.
**Methods**
Using the most recent (2007–16) Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 91 LMICs, we described antenatal care quality based on receipt of three essential services (blood pressure monitoring and urine and blood testing) among women who had at least one visit with a skilled antenatal-care provider. We compared quality across country income groups and quantified within-country wealth-related inequalities using the slope and relative indices of inequality. We summarised inequalities using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the extent to which other geographical and sociodemographic factors could explain these inequalities.
**Findings**
Globally, 72·9% (95% CI 69·1–76·8) of women who used antenatal care reported blood pressure monitoring and urine and blood testing; this number ranged from 6·3% in Burundi to 100·0% in Belarus. Antenatal care quality lagged behind antenatal care coverage the most in low-income countries, where 86·6% (83·4–89·7) of women accessed care but only 53·8% (44·3–63·3) reported receiving the three services. Receipt of the three services was correlated with gross domestic product per capita and was 40 percentage points higher in upper-middle-income countries compared with low-income countries. Within countries, the wealthiest women were on average four times more likely to report good quality care than the poorest (relative index of inequality 4·01, 95% CI 3·90–4·13). Substantial inequality remained after adjustment for subnational region, urban residence, maternal age, education, and number of antenatal care visits (3·20, 3·11–3·30).
**Interpretation**
Many LMICs that have reached high levels of antenatal care coverage had much lower and inequitable levels of quality. Achieving ambitious maternal, newborn, and child health goals will require greater focus on the quality of health services and their equitable distribution. Equity in effective coverage should be used as the new metric to monitor progress towards universal health coverage.
